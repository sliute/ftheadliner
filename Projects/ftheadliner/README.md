# FT Headliner

A tech test for FT.com

## Brief

```
Build a website that shows a list of news headlines from Financial Times. You may use our Developer APIs to achieve this.

Provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).

Optionally, provide pagination for results, at 20 results per page.

This website should be:
- Server-rendered
- Progressively enhanced
- Responsive
- Accessible

For bonus points, the site should:
- Be built using Javascript and node.js
- Be deployed on Heroku
- Not rely too heavily on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
- Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
- Be performant over 3G networks

It'd be really awesome if, on top of all that, your site:
- Uses Origami Components
- Works offline
